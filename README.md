# Cities: Skylines - Road Assets
This repository contains a collection of asset resources for [Cities: Skylines](https://store.steampowered.com/app/255710/Cities_Skylines/) that are commonly used to decorate roads and help visualize node traffic rules set by [TM:PE](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1637663252). All assets and resources have either been created from scratch or taken from other sources in which case proper credits have been given.
# Motivation

From buildings and props to trees and vehicles the Steam workshop contains a lot of amazing assets created by talented creators, however at the moment there seems to be a serious lack of quality road assets. Cities: Skylines is a city building game so road assets should be considered one of the most important types of asset a city builder can have at his disposal. For this reason I have decided to make my contribution by creating and releasing said assets.

# How to download?

You can find the complete list of released asset packs on the [releases](https://github.com/yooksi/cs-road-assets/releases) repository page. Download links for asset and project files for each release can be found by expanding the `Assets` keyword at the bottom of each release.

Note that each release should be considered as a standalone release *(doesn't contain assets from other releases)*.

# Contributing

There are a few ways you can contribute to this project:

- Reporting [issues](https://github.com/yooksi/cs-road-assets/issues) with assets (properties, models or textures).
- Giving feedback on the Steam workshop page with ratings and comments.
- Creating or improving asset resources via PR's after reading contributing guidelines.
